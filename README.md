The Online Community Forum is a Java-based application designed to provide an interactive digitalplatform for users to communicate, share knowledge, and participate in meaningful discussions. 
It enables users to create posts, comment on others’ posts, and like content, thereby fostering engagement and collaboration within an online community.
The project includes two main modules: the User Module and the Admin Module. 
The User Module allows registered users to create accounts, log in securely, and actively take part in discussions by adding, viewing, or responding to posts. 
The Admin Module offers tools for managing users, moderating content, and maintaining the integrity of the forum environment. 
Developed using Core Java, the application employs JDBC for database connectivity and MySQL as the backend database for storing user data, posts, and comments.
The graphical user interface is created with Java Swing or JavaFX, ensuring a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly design. 
The system follows a three-layered architecture separating the interface, business logic, and database layers, which enhances scalability and ease of maintenance. 
To ensure security, the project implements authentication mechanisms and role-based access control, protecting user information and preventing unauthorized access. 
The project applies fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and modularity to achieve reusability and efficient design. 
Overall, this Java-based Online Community Forum demonstrates the practical implementation of software engineering principles to develop a dynamic, secure, and community-driven communication platform 
that can be effectively used by educational institutions, organizations, or social groups for information exchange and collaboration.
